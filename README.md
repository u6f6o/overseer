# overseer

As I started digging deepter into clojure, I created this project to try certain things out and apply stuff I read in [Clojure Programming](http://www.clojurebook.com/) using a simple real life example (parsing csv, calculate certain stuff, print results in JSON format). 

The main focus was to learn clojure and not to do things completelly right (e.g. there is no rounding after calculation which messes up the numbers etc.). 

My current plan is to further add certain components/frameworks (probably REST) to get familiar with the clojure eco system. If this repo might be helpful to you, use it for whatever you desire. 

## Usage

   - clone the repo
